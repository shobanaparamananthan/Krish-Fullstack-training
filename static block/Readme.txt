Static block 
static block code run once for each time a class loaded into memory .A static block is a block of code with a static keyword.So whatever order it is  this static block runs first .Then other methods and constrctors get executed 

Empty block 
An empty block doesnt have anything but an empty pair of braces.This will get executed after static block and before default constructor.A block can be used where  statement can occur.Empty block will be called when you are creating the object with new keyword.

constructor 
A default constructor is a constructor that either has no parameters.If we do not have any constructor then compiler will create default constructor .Default constructor will execute after static block and empty block .
